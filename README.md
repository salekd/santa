# Santa detector

If you do not want to miss Santa during Christmas, this is the solution for you. This repository shows how to build a Santa detector based on the following key components:

* use a deep learning model in **Keras** for image recognition,
* use a serverless function deployed by **OpenFaaS**.

The documentation for this project can be found here https://github.com/salekd/santa/wiki

The serverless function can be easily integrated into my other project, the Raspberry Pi smart security camera.
In this way, you are for sure not going to miss Santa when he comes during Christmas!

The following tutorials by Adrian Rosebrock have been a great source of inspiration for this project. I also used the dataset he prepared for the model building.
