# Santa detector

If you do not want to miss Santa during Christmas, this is the solution for you. This repository shows how to build a Santa detector based on the following key components:

* use a deep learning model in **Keras** for image recognition,
* use a serverless function deployed by **OpenFaaS**.

The installation procedure is documented here https://github.com/salekd/santa/wiki

The serverless function can be easily integrated into my other project, the Raspberry pi smart security camera. https://github.com/salekd/rpizero_smart_camera3

The following tutorials by Adrian Rosebrock have been a great source of inspiration for this project:
